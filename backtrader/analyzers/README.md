# backtrader.analyzers

This module contains performance and risk analyzers for the backtrader framework.
Analyzers compute metrics such as returns, Sharpe ratio, SQN, and more, and can be
attached to strategies for post-trade analysis.

## Key Components

- Timereturn, SQN, and other analyzers
- Extensible for custom analysis

## TODOs

- [ ] Add more built-in analyzers for risk and performance
- [ ] Improve documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Ensure all analyzers have tests and docstrings
