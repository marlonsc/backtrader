# backtrader.sizers

This module provides position sizing classes for the backtrader framework. Sizers
determine the size of each trade based on strategy logic, risk management, and
portfolio constraints.

## Key Components

- Built-in sizers (FixedSize, PercentSizer, etc.)
- Extensible for custom sizing logic

## TODOs

- [ ] Add more sizer types for advanced position management
- [ ] Improve documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Ensure all sizers have tests and docstrings
