# backtrader.observers

This module provides observer classes for the backtrader framework. Observers
monitor and record metrics during strategy execution, such as cash, trades, and
positions, and can be used for visualization and analysis.

## Key Components

- Built-in observers (Broker, BuySell, Trades, DataTrades)
- Extensible for custom observers

## TODOs

- [ ] Add more observer types for additional metrics
- [ ] Improve observer documentation and examples
- [ ] Ensure all observers have tests and docstrings
